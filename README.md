# PiicoDev® Atmospheric Sensor BME280

![](Documents/piicodev-atmospheric-sensor.jpg)

This is the repo for the Core Electronics [PiicoDev Atmospheric Sensor BME280](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE07503).

The PiicoDev® Atmospheric Sensor allows you to easily measure barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature. Use it to build your own weather station or perform experiments. Better still, you can connect to this sensor using our PiicoDev system - no soldering is required to connect the PiicoDev Atmospheric Sensor to other devices in the PiicoDev family.

**Features**

- Measure temperature, pressure and relative humidity
- PiicoDev connector, compatible with Qwiic and STEMMA QT (3.3V only)
- 2.54mm breakout for breadboarding/prototyping
- Manufactured and [supported](https://core-electronics.com.au/contacts/) in Australia by Core Electronics

**Technical Specifications**

- The BME280 measures
  - -40 to +85°C
  - 0 to 100% Relative Humidity
